/**
 * OSCCTRL: setup XOSC1 with 12 MHz
 * multiplier and current according to table 28-7.
 * if everything is left on default, the controller will start with the
 * internal 48 MHz FDPLL0 oscillator, routed to GLCK0.
 * GLCK0 will provide the clock for MCLK, which clocks the CPU, the bus
 * and the modules connected to the bus.
 * However, some peripherals need a separate asynchronous clock and
 * some interfaces of modules must first be unmasked to be clocked by
 * the synchronous bus clock.
 * 
 * init an external crystal oscillator to 12 MHz
